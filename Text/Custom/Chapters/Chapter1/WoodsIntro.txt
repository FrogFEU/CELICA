Hey.[AN]
[Beat][AN]
Hey, wake up.[A]
[MR][LoadFey][CloseEyes]
[MR]
Ugh[Beat][A]
[ML]
As fun as sleeping on the ground is,[N]
there are some urgent matters for us[AN]
to take care of, and I need you awake[N]
for them.[A]
[MR]
[OpenEyes]What[Beat]?[.4] Who are you?[A]
[ML]
My name is irrelevant right now. You may[N]
refer to me as the [Red]Keeper[Red].[AN]
The previous one, to be precise.[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Is there something wrong[N]
with your head?[A]
[ML]
I suppose I should start[N]
from the beginning.[AN]
Take a look at the book in[N]
your hand, would you?[A]
[MR]
Book?[.] What-[.4][A][X]

## Intro2
[ML][LoadMarth]
[MR][LoadFey][MMR]
Wait, this isn't mine![A]
[ML]
Incorrect.[AN]
This is the [Red]Book of Creation[Red], and it[N]
has chosen you to be the next [Red]Keeper[Red].[AN]
No one else shall take it from you -[N]
or even lay their eyes on it.[A]
[MR]
The book[.4] chose[.4] me?[A]
[ML]
As I have mentioned already, yes.[AN]
You are to [Red]record[Red] your surroundings[N]
with it as the basis for a [Red]new world[Red],[AN]
as this one is fast approaching its end.[A][X]

## Intro3
[ML][LoadMarth]
[MR][LoadFey]
You're insane.[.4] I'm leaving.[A]
[ML]
Leaving?[MML] You cannot leave![A]
[MR]
Watch me.[A][X]

## Intro4
[ML][LoadMarth]
[MR][LoadFey][MMR]
What is going on?![AN]
[ML]
To waste the last vestiges of my[N]
power on such foolishness[Beat][AN]
Perhaps you fail to understand[N]
the gravity of the situation.[AN]
The world is ending.[A] [Red]Today[Red].[AN]
And you are the only one capable[N]
of creating the next one.[AN]
A better one.[A]
[MR]
[MMR]I don't care for your books[N]
and worlds![MMR] Let me go![A]
[ML]
Of all the people to be chosen-[N]
Are you even listening to me?[AN]
The world.[.6] Is.[.6] Ending.[.6][A] The apocalypse[N]
is here.[.6] Everyone is going to die.[AN]
Do you truly not care[N]
about any of that?[A]
[MR]
[Beat][A]
[ML]
Good. Because you have [Red]powers[Red], which you[N]
must use before your inevitable death.[A]
[MR]
Powers to save the world?[A]
[ML]
What? No, of course not.[AN]
This world was doomed the moment I-[.4][N]
that is, from the beginning.[AN]
We need to focus on the next one.[A]
[MR]
Then what good are they?![A]
[ML]
Oh, they are quite good, I can assure you.[AN]
You can [Red]reshape[Red] anyone you touch by[N]
[Red]exchanging[Red] their properties with ones[AN]
currently [Red]stored[Red] inside the[N]
Book of Creation.[A]
[MR]
Huh?[A]
[ML]
Perhaps a demonstration is in order.[4.][N]
Try to-[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MR]
What was that?![A]
[ML]
The land breaking apart, probably.[N]
Please remain-[A]
[MR]
I heard screams.[4.] From the village![A]
[ML]
Yes, peasants do tend to panic.[4.][AN]
Now, let us-[4.]
[MR][ClearFace]
[ML]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[MML][N]Where are you going?![A][X]
