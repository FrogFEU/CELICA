[MR]
By executive order of His Holiness[N]
King Michael Philips XII,[AN]
this village is now the property[N]
of the King Himself,[AN]
and all civilians are to leave its[N]
premise within the hour.[AN]
Lay down your arms, and you shall be[N]
compensated with two fresh cakes.[AN]
I am talking to you, kids.[A]
[Left]
We're not dropping our weapons[N]
until you leave our village.[A]
[MR]
I am running out of patience here.[4.] Don't[N]
test me again if you value your life.[A]
[FL][MFL]
E-Enough![4.] Honourable general, I am-[A]
[Left][MLeft]
Achilles, don't-[A]
[FL]
No, someone must stop this[N]
meaningless fighting.[AN]
I am the prince of Gothill,[4.][N]
Achilles Gothill,[4.][AN]
and I wish to have an audience[N]
with the king.[A]
[MR]
[Beat]The prince, you say?[N]
[CloseEyes]Well.[4.][OpenEyes] This changes things.[A]
[FL]
I-It does?[4.] I mean, of course it does.[N]
Now, let us-[A]
[MR]
The King wants your head, boy.[AN]
I was willing to let you go before, but[N]
my hands are tied now, I'm afraid.[A]
[FL]
[MFL]W-What?![MFL] I-Impossible![A]
[Left][MLeft]
You monsters![A]
[ClearFace]
[LoadKlicas]
Achilles, look out![A][X]

We have to get out of here![4.] Now![A]
[FL]
R-right![A][X]

## VillageIntroSolSpeech
[MR][LoadSol]
You've made the smart move[N]
by fleeing, prince.[AN]
I truly hope you won't[N]
come back.[A][X]

[Left][LoadFlick]
Fey?![A]
[Right]
Felix! What's going on?[A]
[Left]
Some king or other decided to kick us out.[4.][N]
By force.[A]
[Right][MRight]
Why?![A]
[Left]
How should I know?[4.] That's just[N]
what kings do, I guess.[A]
[FL][LoadMila]
Fey? Oh, you're back![MFL] Thank the Gods![AN]
Listen.[4.] You must get Achilles to see reason.[4.][N]
He wants us to fight them![A]
[Right]
Well, of course. We can't just[Beat][N]
abandon everyone![A]
[FR][LoadAchilles]
Exactly![A]
[Left]
[ClearFace]
[LoadKlicas]
Achilles, stop this foolishness.[N]
And don't encourage him, Fey.[AN]
We need to get out of here and[N]
keep His Highness safe.[AN]
This entire trip was a mistake.[A]
[Right]
At the cost of everyone else's lives?[A]
[FR]
Caspian, you are the one who[N]
needs to see reason.[AN]
My duty as a prince is to protect the[N]
people,[MFR] not flee at their expanse![AN]
My decision is final. I o-order you[N]
to protect this village![A]
[Left]
My lord, please reconsider! This is[N]
for your own protection.[AN]
I cannot guarantee your[N]
safety if we stay.[A]
[FR][MFR]
I-I shall not leave![A]
[FL]
Achilles[Beat][MFL] I-I will protect you![N]
Don't worry, Caspian, he'll be safe![AN]
We know how to use weapons. Right?[A]
[Left]
Even you, Mira?[4.] [CloseEyes][Beat][6.]His majesty will have[N]
my head if he hears about this[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]
Very well, then. If you insist on staying,[AN]
then I will fight until my last breath to[N]
protect you![A][X]

[ML]
So is this your grand plan now?[AN]
Fighting a hopeless battle to save[N]
an already doomed people?[A]
[Right]
[CloseEyes]Oh, shut up.[A]
[FR][LoadFlick]
Excuse me?[A]
[Right]
[OpenEyes]What? No, I[Beat][A]
[ML]
Ah, yes. I probably should have[N]
mentioned it before.[AN]
[Red]Only you can see or hear me[Red].[A]
[Right]
[CloseEyes][Beat]Oh, of course.[OpenEyes] I was just[N]
hearing voices all along.[A]
[ML]
What? No, I am very much real.[N]
And so is the end of the world.[AN]
Which means, we have no time[N]
to waste on-[A]
[Right]
Sorry, Felix. Let's get[N]
back to the others.[A]
[FR]
Okay then.[A]
[ClearFace]
[Right]
[ClearFace]
[ML][MML]
Stop! Listen, you must-[AN]
Ugh. I guess she will have to see for[N]
herself the futility of this endeavour.[A][X]
