Hey.[A] Hey, listen to me.[A]
[MR]
[CloseEyes]
[Beat]What do you want?[A]
[ML]
I understand that the current situation[N]
in your village might be a tad upsetting.[AN]
But this is no time for frivolous problems[N]
to cloud your judgement.[AN]
We have more important things to do.[A]
[MR]
[OpenEyes]
Are the lives of me and my[N]
friends not important enough?[A]
[ML]
In the face of the destruction[N]
of the Earth? I would say yes.[A]
[MR]
[ClearFace]
[LoadFey]
Do you know my name?[A]
[ML]
Excuse me?[A]
[MR]
Do you even know my name?[A]
[ML]
As I have already mentioned,[N]
names are irrelevant.[4.] We must-[A]
[MR]
You don't care about me.[4.] About my friends.[4.][N]
[MMR]About any of us![AN]
The only thing you care about is[N]
that precious new world of yours![A]
[ML]
Because this is so much bigger than you![AN]
Than any one individual,[4.] or village,[4.][N]
or kingdom.[AN]
The lives of countless unborn people[N]
are in your hands,[4.] right now.[AN]
Going on pointless tirades at this time is-[A]
[MR]
Stop.[6.][CloseEyes] Just stop it.[6.][N]
[MMR][OpenEyes]Get out of my head![AN]

Hello again.[A]
[MR]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A]
[ML]
Listen. Please. The world is at its[N]
end - we have almost no time left.[A]
[MR]
[Beat][A]
[ML]
I am aware that you dislike me.[6.][N]
Hate me, even.[AN]
I can even vaguely understand the sort of[N]
thinking that led you to this conclusion.[AN]
But please, for my - and everyone who will[N]
come after us - sake:[AN]
[Red]do not keep any trace of the undead[N]
inside the Book of Creation[Red].[A]
[MR]
[Beat][A]
[ML]
Can you grant me this one request?[A]
[MR]
[OpenEyes]Is this all?[A]
[ML]
Well, I can think of several more-[A]
[MR]
[CloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove].[6.].[6.].[6.][A]
[ML]
[Beat]Yes. That is all.[A]
[MR]
[OpenEyes]We'll see.[A]
[ClearFace]
[ML]
Was that a yes?[AN]
[Beat]Keeper?[AN]
Ugh. So obnoxious![A][X]

## MorbiusArrive
[ML][LoadMorbius]
Oh, yes.[4.] I can feel it.[4.] I can taste it![AN]
This is the place.[4.] The dead[Beat][4.] I can[N]
hear their whispers. Their cries![AN]
The beg me to free them.[4.] Liberate[N]
them from the earth! Aha[MML]ha[MML]ha[MML]![AN]
Today. Today is the day[Beat][N]
When I shall command death itself![A][X]

[ML]
Come on, Norman.[4.] Stop lazing around[N]
and let's join the others![A]
[MR]
[MMR]I'm not lazing around! I just don't[N]
think they need our help.[AN]
Mira and the rest seem to be doing[N]
just fine.[A]
[ML]
Oh, don't be like that. We need to[N]
do our part too or something![AN]
Besides, we're outside already,[N]
so we might as well help them.[A]
[MR]
It's not too late. Maybe[N]
they haven't seen us yet.[A]
[FL]
Gisella?[4.] Norman?[4.] Is that you?[A]
[ML]
[MML]Yep! We arrive yet again[N]
to save the day![AN]
Thank us later![A]
[MR]
[Beat]And now it's too late.[AN]
Ugh,[CloseEyes] fine.[OpenEyes] Fine![AN]
Just[Beat] Let's make it out[N]
of here alive, yeah?[A]
[ML]
Sure thing! Why, I haven't[N]
killed you yet, have I?[AN]
Now let's go![A]
[ClearFace]
[MR]
[Beat]Very reassuring.[A][X]

## MikeArrive
[ML][LoadMike]
What's this noise? Is it[Beat][N]
fighting? In the village?![AN]
No, no, no! I must hurry![AN]
Please, gods, let me arrive[N]
before it's too late[Beat][A][X]
